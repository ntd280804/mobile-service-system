|Optional Model:
|The business modeling workflow in Rational Unified Process produces two models: the business use-case model, and the business object model. Both show the business 
|processes, but different aspects of them. In the business use-case model each business use case represents a business process, described (text and/or activity diagrams) from an "external" view point without worrying about who does what to whom inside of the organization. 
|In the business object model, you include realizations of each business use case to show how workers and entities collaborate to perform the process. You do that using class diagrams, activity diagrams with swimlanes, collaboration diagrams, and/or interaction diagrams.

|<Any additional description of the Business Use Case Model, such as modeling conventions that the reader/reviewer may need to understand the model, should be described here.>

|This model is optional.
|The Business Object Model contains a set of interacting workers and business entity (domain) classes which collaborate to enact the business processes.  In some cases, only the business entity classes are documented.  The business entity classes as a whole are sometimes referred to as a 'domain model'.
|
|The business modeling workflow in Rational Unified Process produces two models: the business use-case model, and the business object model. Both show the business 
|processes, but different aspects of them. In the business use-case model each business use case represents a business process, described (text and/or activity diagrams) from an "external" view point without worrying about who does what to whom inside of the organization. 
|In the business object model, you include realizations of each business use case to show how workers and entities collaborate to perform the process. You do that using class diagrams, activity diagrams with swimlanes, collaboration diagrams, and/or interaction diagrams.

|The Design Model in Rational Unified Process.
|The design model is adapted to model the real implementation environment, and serves as an abstraction of the source code. It is a "blueprint" of how the source code is structured and written. 
|
|The design model is a hierarchy of packages (design subsystems and design-service  packages), with "leaves" that are classes. Subsystems are a design "view" of the components that are defined in the Implementation Model.
|
|The design model hierarchy consists of layers. 
|
|Classes represent abstractions of classes in the system's implementation. They define the objects, which in turn are abstractions of the objects in the system's implementation. The use cases are realized by the objects, and this is represented by use-case realizations in the Design Model.  Each use-case realization has a realize dependency to a use case in the Use-Case Model.

|Welcome to the Rational Unified Process Frame Work
|
|Purpose of the FrameWork:
|a) provide a good structure for a Rose model
|b) provide a style guide with naming conventions/suggestions
|c) identify a minimal set of diagrams to produce
|d) relate activities in RUP to Rose diagrams
|e) provide a basis for sophisticated SoDA reports. For instance based on this structure most of the Rose parts of the "Software Architecture Document" are generated from SoDA.

|Welcome to the Rational Unified Process Rose Model Framework
|
|Purpose of the Framework:
|a) provide a good structure for a Rose model
|b) provide a style guide with naming conventions/suggestions
|c) identify a minimal set of diagrams to produce
|d) relate activities in RUP to Rose diagrams
|e) provide a basis for sophisticated SoDA reports. For instance based on this structure most of the Rose parts of the "Software Architecture Document" are generated from SoDA.
